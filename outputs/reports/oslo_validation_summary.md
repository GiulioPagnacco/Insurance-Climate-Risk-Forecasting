## MAJOR FINDINGS

### 1. Correlation Analysis

**Precipitation → Claims Correlation: r = +0.330, p = 0.0655**

This demonstrates a **moderate positive relationship** between quarterly precipitation and insurance claim payouts in Oslo. While not reaching strict statistical significance (p < 0.05), the correlation is:
- In the expected direction (positive)
- Approaching significance (p = 0.0655)
- Consistent with weather→claims causality

**Interpretation:**
- Moderate predictive power
- Some quarters show strong weather-claims link
- Other quarters have non-weather claim drivers

**Comparison to Literature:**
- NHH Thesis (Gorji & Rødal, 2021): Oslo daily AUC = 0.67
- Our finding: r = +0.330 quarterly (weaker but same direction)
- ✅ **Directional validation successful**

### 2. Extreme Event Detection

**Identified Events:**

1. **2015-Q3: September Flooding** ✅
   - Claims: **18.8M NOK** (highest quarter in 8 years)
   - Precipitation: 15.0mm (+2.29 std above mean)
   - Risk level: **EXTREME**
   - ✅ **Correctly flagged** - Highest precipitation quarter matches highest claims quarter

2. **2018-Q3: Summer Event** ⚠️
   - Claims: 9.1M NOK
   - Precipitation: 7.6mm (-0.28 std - normal)
   - ⚠️ **Not precipitation-driven** - Other factors (storms, hail, etc.)

3. **2020-Q2: Spring Event** ⚠️
   - Claims: 9.4M NOK
   - Precipitation: 6.4mm (-0.69 std - below average)
   - ⚠️ **Not precipitation-driven** - Non-rainfall claims

**Detection Performance:**
- Extreme events (>5M NOK): 3 total
- Correctly identified by high precipitation: 1 of 3 (33%)
- **Key insight:** Not all high-loss quarters are precipitation-driven

### 3. Event Detection Metrics

**Predicting Top 25% Claims Quarters:**
- Accuracy: 62.5%
- Precision: 25.0% (when forecast high, claims are high)
- Recall: 25.0% (of high claim quarters, % correctly flagged)
- F1 Score: 0.250

**Confusion Matrix:**
- True Positives: 2 (correctly forecast high-loss)
- False Positives: 6 (false alarms)
- False Negatives: 6 (missed events)
- True Negatives: 18 (correctly forecast low-loss)

**Interpretation:**
- Low precision/recall reflects weak correlation
- Many high-claim quarters are NOT high-precipitation quarters
- Suggests multiple claim drivers beyond rainfall

---

## METHODOLOGY

### Data Processing

1. **Claims Data:**
   - Extracted Oslo quarterly payouts from NASK database
   - Converted 1000 NOK units to millions
   - Flagged extreme (>5M) and high (>3M) quarters

2. **Precipitation Data:**
   - Downloaded ERA5 monthly precipitation (2014-2021)
   - Spatially averaged over Oslo area
   - Aggregated to quarterly totals
   - Calculated anomalies (vs. 8-year mean)

3. **Integration:**
   - Merged datasets by year/quarter
   - 32 quarters with complete data
   - No missing values

### Statistical Analysis
- Pearson correlation (linear relationship)
- Spearman correlation (non-parametric validation)
- Significance testing (p-value)
- Event detection metrics (precision, recall, F1)

### Validation Approach
- Compare to thesis findings (Oslo AUC = 0.67)
- Verify known extreme events (2015 flooding)
- Test predictive skill across all quarters

---

## LIMITATIONS & LEARNINGS

### 1. Correlation Weaker Than Thesis
**Finding:** r = +0.330 (moderate) vs. Thesis AUC = 0.67 (strong)

**Possible Reasons:**
- **Temporal resolution:** Quarterly vs. daily (smoothing effect)
- **Data source:** ERA5 monthly means may underestimate extremes
- **Time period:** 2014-2021 vs. thesis different period
- **Method:** Direct correlation vs. machine learning
- **Claim types:** All perils vs. thesis focused on specific types

**Implication:** Quarterly forecasts have some predictive value but weaker than daily models

### 2. Multiple Claim Drivers
**Finding:** Only 1 of 3 extreme quarters strongly precipitation-driven

**Claim Drivers Identified:**
- Precipitation (2015-Q3: 18.8M NOK)
- Other weather (2018-Q3, 2020-Q2: storms, hail, wind?)
- Non-weather (urban flooding, infrastructure, etc.)

**Implication:** Precipitation forecasts capture ~33% of extreme events. Need multi-variate models for better prediction.

### 3. ERA5 Monthly Data Limitations
**Finding:** Precipitation values seem low (3-16mm per quarter)

**Issue:** ERA5 monthly means are AVERAGED, not SUMMED
- Monthly mean: Average daily precip that month
- Quarterly total: Sum of 3 monthly means
- This underestimates total quarterly rainfall

**Fix for Future:** Use ERA5 daily data and sum to quarterly totals (not monthly means)

### 4. Geographic Scope
**Limitation:** Oslo only (no Bergen validation due to data availability)

**Why Oslo Only:**
- NASK public interface provides municipality-level data
- Bergen/Hordaland data requires direct request
- Oslo demonstrates proof-of-concept

**Next Step:** Obtain Bergen data for full Norway validation

---

## COMPARISON TO THESIS

**Gorji & Rødal (2021) Findings:**
- Oslo daily prediction: AUC = 0.67
- Bergen daily prediction: AUC = 0.79 (natural perils)
- Methodology: XGBoost, Neural Networks, Logistic Regression
- Data: Daily claims (2014-2021)

**Our Findings (Oslo Quarterly):**
- Quarterly prediction: r = +0.330
- Simpler approach: Direct correlation, no ML
- Data: Quarterly aggregates (2014-2021)

**Key Differences:**
1. **Resolution:** Daily vs. quarterly (major smoothing)
2. **Data source:** ERA5 monthly means vs. daily
3. **Method:** Correlation vs. classification ML
4. **Target:** Regression vs. binary classification

**Assessment:**
- ✅ Direction correct (positive correlation)
- ⚠️ Magnitude weaker (r=0.33 vs AUC=0.67)
- ✅ Major event identified (2015-Q3)
- ⚠️ Lower precision/recall than thesis

## CONCLUSIONS

### Scientific Validation ✅

**Core Hypothesis:** "Quarterly weather observations correlate with insurance claims"

**Verdict:** **PARTIALLY VALIDATED**

Using real historical data from Oslo (2014-2021), we demonstrate:
1. ✅ Positive correlation exists (r = +0.330)
2. ✅ Major precipitation event (2015-Q3) correctly identified
3. ⚠️ Correlation weaker than thesis (quarterly vs. daily effect)
4. ⚠️ Many high-claim quarters NOT precipitation-driven

**Conclusion:** Quarterly precipitation forecasts have **some** predictive value, but are not sufficient alone. Multi-variate models needed.

### Technical Validation ✅

**Infrastructure:** **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

1. ✅ Real NASK claims data integration
2. ✅ ERA5 climate data download & processing
3. ✅ Quarterly aggregation pipeline
4. ✅ Statistical analysis framework
5. ✅ Visualization generation

**Weaknesses:**
- Correlation weaker than expected (r=0.33)
- Low precision (25%) - many false alarms
- Low recall (25%) - many missed events
- Only captures ~33% of extreme quarters

**Path Forward:**
1. **Enhance with multi-variate model:**
   - Add temperature, wind, storm indicators
   - Use daily data (not monthly means)
   - Apply machine learning (XGBoost, Neural Nets)

2. **Target specific claim types:**
   - Focus on precipitation-driven perils only
   - Exclude wind/hail/other weather claims
   - Filter to specific insurance products

3. **Test seasonal forecasts:**
   - Current analysis uses observations (ERA5)
   - Next: Test SEAS5 seasonal forecasts
   - Validate forecast skill, not just observation correlation

**🎯 Next Actions:**
- Fix ERA5 data (use daily, not monthly means)
- Add multi-variate predictors (wind, temp, storms)
- Test SEAS5 seasonal forecasts
- Obtain Bergen data for full validation

### Recommended Message

"We completed Oslo validation with real NASK data. Results show **moderate positive correlation (r=+0.330)**, successfully identifying the 2015-Q3 major event. However, correlation is weaker than your thesis, likely due to:
1. Quarterly aggregation (vs. daily in thesis)
2. ERA5 monthly means (should use daily data)
3. Single-variate model (precipitation only)

The **infrastructure is proven** - we can process real data end-to-end. For commercial viability, we need to:
- Use daily ERA5 data
- Add multi-variate predictors
- Test seasonal forecasts (SEAS5)

Would appreciate your thoughts on methodology and next steps."
