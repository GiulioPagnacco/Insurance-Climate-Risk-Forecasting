## Value Proposition

### Customer Economics

**Baseline Insurer (â‚¬2B premiums):**

**Current State:**
- Natural perils premiums: â‚¬300M (15% of total)
- Loss ratio: 75% (â‚¬225M payouts)
- Combined ratio: 95% (â‚¬5M profit on natural perils segment)
- Unpredictable quarterly variance: Â±â‚¬15-30M

**Problem:**
- Cannot predict quarterly claim spikes
- Set prices based on multi-year averages
- Caught off-guard by seasonal extremes
- Reserves misallocated (too high in good quarters, too low in bad)

**With Quarterly Climate Forecasting:**

**Value Driver 1: Risk-Adjusted Pricing**
- Increase premiums 5-10% for high-risk quarters
- Decrease premiums 2-5% for low-risk quarters (competitive advantage)
- **Net impact:** +2% premiums (â‚¬6M/year)

**Value Driver 2: Reserves Optimization**
- Allocate reserves based on forecasted risk
- Reduce reserve buffer by 10-15% (better capital efficiency)
- **Net impact:** â‚¬3-5M capital freed (0.25% ROE improvement)

**Value Driver 3: Reinsurance Optimization**
- Negotiate quarterly risk-based reinsurance pricing
- Reduce reinsurance cost by 3-5%
- **Net impact:** â‚¬1-2M/year savings

**Value Driver 4: Customer Risk Communication**
- Warn high-risk customers to prepare
- Reduce claim severity by 2-3%
- **Net impact:** â‚¬4-7M/year savings

**Total Value:** â‚¬14-20M/year advantage
**Cost of Product:** â‚¬300-500K/year
**ROI:** 30-60x

**Realistic Conservative Estimate:** â‚¬2-4M/year value (still 5-10x ROI)

| **Tier 3** | Enterprise Custom | Real-time, multi-country, white-label | â‚¬500K+ | Large (â‚¬3B+) |

**Pilot Pricing:**
- 6-month pilot: â‚¬50K (2 quarters delivered)

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

**1. In-House Climate Teams**

- **Mitigation:** Focus on mid-size Nordics without teams, or augment large teams
- **Differentiation:** Faster, cheaper, ECMWF-specific expertise

**2. Reinsurance Brokers (Aon, Willis Towers Watson)**
- **Threat:** Already provide catastrophe modeling

## Key Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Low Correlation in Target Markets

**Risk:** Denmark correlation weaker than Norway (r < 0.2)

**Mitigation:**
- Multi-variate model (wind + temperature + precipitation)
- Partner with customer for proprietary data
- Focus on event detection (not just correlation)
- Pivot to Norway market if Denmark weak

### Risk 2: Customer Procurement Timelines

**Risk:** Insurance procurement takes 12-18 months

**Mitigation:**
- Start with pilots (â‚¬50-100K, faster approval)
- Advisor-led intros (skip RFP process)
- Focus on mid-size insurers (faster decisions)

### Risk 3: Competitive Response

**Risk:** RMS/AIR Worldwide add seasonal forecasting

**Mitigation:**
- Speed to market (6-12 month head start)
- Nordic specialization (they focus global)
- Customer lock-in (annual contracts, integrated workflows)

### Risk 4: ECMWF Forecast Skill Degradation

**Risk:** SEAS5 skill lower than expected (correlation < 0.3)

**Mitigation:**
- Multi-model ensemble (add NOAA CFSv2, UK Met Office GloSea)
- Probabilistic forecasting (communicate uncertainty)
- Hybrid approach (forecasts + climatology)
